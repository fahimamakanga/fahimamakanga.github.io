    <h1>Growth, when clarity matters</h1>

    <p>I work with companies that grow under pressure.</p>

    <p>
      My background sits at the intersection of technology, communication and public exposure.
      I've worked in highly regulated environments, international tech companies,
      media organizations, and crisis-adjacent contexts.
      What connects all of it is this: growth fails when understanding breaks down.
      My role as a Growth Directress is to prevent that.
      I focus on keeping organizations steerable as complexity increases.
      That means translating between (technical) teams, leadership and external Stakeholders,
      aligning decisions before misalignment becomes structural,
      and making sure growth doesn't outpace responsibility.
      I don't approach growth as a visibility problem.
      I approach it as a coordination problem.
    </p>

    <h2>What I actually do</h2>

    <p>I help leadership teams stay in control while scaling. That includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>structuring communication across product, leadership, and public interfaces</li>
      <li>anticipating where misunderstanding turn into risk</li>
      <li>building narratives that hold internally and externally</li>
      <li>supporting decisions in moments where speed and responsibility collide</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm used to operating where stakes are real:
      public scrunity, regulatory attention, technological complexity,
      and reputational risk.
      I don't optimize for attention.
      I optimize for coherence.
    </p>

    <h2>Why it matters</h2>

    <p>
      Scale amplifies everything.
      If assumptions are unclear, they spread.
      If communication is fragmented, control erodes.
      If responsibility isn't explicit, trust breaks first.
      Companies don't lose momentum because they lack ambition.
      They lose it because clarity dissapears faster than they notice.
      My work is about slowing that erosion down before it becomes visible.
    </p>

    <h2>How I work with leaders</h2>

    <p>
      I work best with leaders who:
      carry responsibility for complex systems
      understand that growth is not neutral
      value clear judgement over constant acceleration
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're looking for someone to push numbers at all costs,
      I'm not the right fit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're looking for someone who helps you grow
      without loosing oversight, context, and trust,
      we should talk.
